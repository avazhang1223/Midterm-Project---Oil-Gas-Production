# Part 1. Dataset Description

County-level Oil and Gas Production in the U.S. dataset is a national county-level database by Economic Research Service researchers. It includes disaggregated data from State agencies EIA (Energy Information Administration), county-level production statistics by States, and well-level databases. This dataset provides gas and oil production for counties in the lower 48 States, from 2000 to 2011. It also includes variables related to rural-urban, metro-nonmetro factors. More information is available on website http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-oil-and-gas-production-in-the-us/documentation-and-maps/. 


# Part 2. Tidy Data

##Step I. Revise Column Headers

After reading the raw dataset, the first thing we did is to change a couple of column headers to simpler and more readable ones. For example, we revised the column header “Rural_Urban_Continuum_Code_2013” to “Population Level”. 

##Step II. Separate Multiple Types in One Table 

Since there are two types of data in the raw table, we decided to split the table into two. One contains information about County, including FIPS, State, Population Level and other metro/non-metro variables. Since the fourth column already showed “County” in its header, we eliminated the word “County” from the column content. The other table includes information about county-level oil and gas production each year from 2000 to 2011.

##Step III. Seperate Multiple Variables in One Column

The second table has multiple variables stored in one column, like “oil2000” for example, so we melted the column headers into rows: “production” and “year”. So now the "production" column includes production types which are either oil or gas, and the "year" coumn includes data year ranging from 2000 to 2011.


# Part 3. Data Summary

For the preparation of future data visualization, we grouped Counties by its population level, introduced a new variable called “County Level” (ranges from level 1 to 9), and created a couple of new tables. The first three tables are average annual oil and gas production for each county, nationwide mean production in each year, and average oil and gas production for counties grouped by each county level (population level). Then we tidied the third table, since it has multiple variables in one column. After that, we created three more tables, which are mean oil and gas production for each county in terms of population level, mean oil production for each county in each year, and mean gas production for each county in each year.


# Part 4. Data Visualization

Based on these tidy tables we created in Part 3, we genearted six different graphs in order to prepare for the future analysis.

##Graph 1. National Mean Oil & Gas Production In Each Year
The following is a double bar chart aiming to compare the national mean oil and gas production in each year.
